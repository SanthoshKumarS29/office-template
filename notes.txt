app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

This line tells Express: I’m using EJS as my templating engine. ex:views/home.ejs

req.params: gets the dynamic portion of the URL.\

let slug = "crypto-exchange-development";

const formatTitle = (slug) => {
    return slug
        .split("-") // ➡️ ["crypto", "exchange", "development"]
        .map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)) 
        // ➡️ ["Crypto", "Exchange", "Development"]
        .join(" "); // ➡️ "Crypto Exchange Development"
};

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

Those are used for modern, cross-platform method to get the current file and directory paths in an ES module (ESM)

seoData[slug] = {metaTitle,metaDescription,metaKeywords};

fs.writeFileSync(SEO_PATH, JSON.stringify(seoData, null, 2))

How it works step-by-step

    The seoData object is passed to JSON.stringify().

    JSON.stringify() converts the object into a JSON string, adding indentation because of the 2 argument.

    The resulting JSON string is passed to fs.writeFileSync().

    fs.writeFileSync() takes the string and writes it to the file specified by the SEO_PATH variable.

    The program's execution is paused until the file has been successfully written to disk.
